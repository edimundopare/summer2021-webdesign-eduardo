# Homework
* Create a [**GitHub**](http://www.github.com/) account. If you already have a GitHub account, feel free to use that one instead.
* Download & install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), make sure to download the correct OS installer.
* If you do not use [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [**Opera**](https://www.opera.com/), download the correct OS installer and install it. You are only required to have one of these web browsers for this class, feel free to download the other ones as well. Google Chrome will be used in-class by the instructor, therefore keep in mind Firefox and Opera may look slightly different compared to Google Chrome but should have pretty much the same features.
